## Force Tanks

For some reason Valve decided not to spawn tanks on the first maps in VS mode.
Using left4dhooks forcing tank chance to 1.0 to spawn tank on every maps with 100% probabilty.

Alternatively, without left4dhooks you can create timer on m1_ maps roundstart and spawn tank after that time.
